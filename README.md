# HandScribe Starter (PHP + Bootstrap)

## Purpose and Features

Handscribe is a web application designed to break down communication barriers between deaf and hearing individuals in a streamlined and intuitive fashion. It utilizes real time footage through cameras in user devices and recordings of ASL signing and translates it into English. The translation goes the other way as well, where audio or text can be input to visualize a live sign language translation on a virtual avatar. The key features include the following;

- All-in-one model, no extra devices or software needed
- Real time translation from:
    Audio -> ASL Avatar | Text -> ASL Avatar | Video ASL -> Subtitles & Live Audio
- Can use both live and pre-recorded videos


This project is a proof of concept for a university capstone course.
