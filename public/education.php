    <p>American Sign Language (ASL) uses hand shapes, movements, and facial expressions to communicate. Basic ASL signs often represent common words and phrases that are essential for everyday communication. For example, the sign for "hello" involves raising your hand to your forehead in a salute-like motion, while "thank you" is made by touching your fingers to your chin and moving your hand forward. Many basic signs are intuitive and relate to the meaning of the word, such as "eat" which mimics bringing food to your mouth, or "drink" which simulates holding a cup and drinking from it.</p>
    <p>Learning fundamental ASL signs can help you communicate with members of the Deaf community and expand your communication skills. Common beginner signs include greetings like "hello," "goodbye," and "nice to meet you," as well as essential words like "yes," "no," "please," and "thank you." Numbers and the alphabet are also foundational, as they allow you to fingerspell words that don't have a specific sign. As you practice, remember that facial expressions and body language are crucial components of ASL, as they convey tone, emotion, and grammatical information that spoken languages express through intonation and word order.</p>
